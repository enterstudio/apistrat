This is supporting material for the [Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) workshop at the 2013 [API Strategy Conference](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/).

The [swagger-workshop-companion-doc](https://github.com/fehguy/apistrat/raw/master/swagger-workshop-companion-doc.pdf) will walk you through the code in this repo, which does the following:

* Demonstrates building a API definition in the _design_ phase

* Helps build the plumbing for the server in the _development_ phase by building skeleton servers in Java, Scala, and Node.js

* Connects clients for the _integration_ phase by building clients in java, objective-c, javascript, and via HTML

Please read the [Software Setup](https://github.com/fehguy/apistrat/raw/master/software-setup.pdf) guide to ensure you have all the software dependencies.
